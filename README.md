# Advanced Document Validator Pro

Advanced Document Validator Pro is a Streamlit web application that leverages an LLM backend to extract structured data from documents (PDFs or images) and validate that data against user-defined rules.

## Features
- **Document Processing**: Upload PDF or image files, extract text with `pdfplumber` (for PDFs) or `pytesseract` (for images), and preview or edit the raw text.
- **Data Extraction**: Use an LLM (via the Ollama CLI) to parse extracted text into structured JSON fields (`money`, `date`, `time`, `text`).
- **Rule Management**: Define validation rules in natural language (e.g. ‚ÄúInvoice date must be after 2025-01-01‚Äù), automatically parsed into JSON (`category`, `condition`, `value`).
- **Validation Dashboard**: Run all rules against the extracted data, view a summary of passes/fails, and inspect detailed results with rich styling.
- **Interactive UI**: Custom CSS for clear rule cards, progress indicators, expandable details, and session-state persistence.
